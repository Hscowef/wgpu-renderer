# Wgpu Renderer

## Add as dependency

This library isn't yet published on [crates.io](https://www.crates.io) but you can add it to your cargo projects
by adding `wgpu_renderer = { git = https://github.com/Hscowef/wgpu-renderer.git }` to the `[dependencies]` section
in your `Cargo.toml` however, I would not recommend you to do so (don't do it really) because it is a extremely wip project. It still has almost
no functionalities and will get a lot modified during the time comming. It is also one of my first computer graphics
project so it will be far from perfect.

## Run the examples

To run the examples run the `cargo run --example example_name` command in your terminal where `example_name` is the name of the example you
want to run. See the [examples](examples) directory to see the avaibles ones.

## Open the documentation

To open the documentation run `cargo +nightly doc --open` in your terminal. It may take some time to execute because it need to build the project.

## Contribute
